# Learn ABAP Repository

In this repository, I'm learning SAP ABAP programming language. I'm following [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/abap).

ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming) is a programming language to modify and extends existing SAP functionality.

Prefix ZCL is used for custom class name to avoid name conflict with the internal SAP names. (Z prefix for custom name; CL stand for class).
